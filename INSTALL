REQUIREMENTS
============

To build JX you need a Linux system with perl, java, and gcc.


BUILDING JX
===========

If you can read this file you probably have a JX source tree. In
the root of this tree there is a file tools/setupenv.tcsh that 
sets environment variables for a tcsh and a corresponding file
tools/setupenv.bash for a bourne shell. Adjust the following variables: 

 JXROOT     the root of the JX source tree (e.g. /home/<username>/jx)
 JDKVERSION your Java installation (e.g. /usr/lib/jdk1.3)

Then source this file (source tools/setupenv.tcsh).

Now select a system configuration. If you want to run the AWT demo
execute the following commands:
cp boot.rc.awt boot.rc
cp libs/COMPONENTS_AWT  libs/COMPONENTS

Now start the build process by typing:
make


BOOTING JX
==========

The build process creates two important files: code.zip and jcore/jxcore.
You must use the grub bootloader to boot jxcore as the kernel and
code.zip as a module.

There are at least two alternatives for booting: create a bootable floppy disk
or boot from a tftp server. A floppy can only be used if the code.zip and
jxcore files both fit on the floppy. To boot from the network you need a
tftpserver, which usually also acts as dhcp server, and a target PC to run JX.


Creating a boot floppy
----------------------
Create a grub boot floppy by using one of the floppy images from our web page.
Then insert this floppy and type "make fd0". 


Booting from the network using tftp
-----------------------------------
Install grub on your target PC and copy the code.zip and jxcore files to the
/tftpboot directory of your tftp server.
Add an entry to grub's menu.lst:

title = JX
bootp
root (nd)
kernel = /tftpboot/jxcore
module = /tftpboot/code.zip
