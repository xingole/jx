This directory contains the Java code for
the different shared libraries.

Each library has its own directory.

Within this directory the directory structure
corresponds to the package structure of the library.

Description of the libraries:

zero:      DEPs of domain zero

jdk0:      the base jdk classes (jdk1.1)

jdk1:      additional jdk classes (jdk1.1)

jdk_2:     some classes conforming to jdk 1.2 API 

bio:       block-I/O DEP

bio_ram:   block-I/O implemenation storing blocks in memory 

bio_ide:   block-I/O implemenation storing blocks on an IDE disk

fs:        DEPs of the Filesystem

fs_javafs: implemenatation of the Java Filesystem (implementing fs)

keyboard:  definition of a generic keyboard

keyboard_pc: implementation of PC keyboard

screen:    definition of a generic screen

screen_pc: implementation of PC screen 

compiler:  all classes of the bytecode-to-native compiler
