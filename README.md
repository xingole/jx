## Introduction 

JX is a microkernel operating system with both the kernel and applications implemented using the **Java** programming language.

JX is implemented as an extended ***Java virtual machine*** (the *JX Core*), adding support to the Java system for necessary 
features such as protection domains and hardware access, along with a number of components written in Java that provide kernel 
facilities to applications running on the computer.
